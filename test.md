## 🤝 How to Contribute (For Team Members Only)

This guide is only for our team members — **Pollob, Ahiqur, and Tanzid** — so that we can work in parallel, stay organized, and collaborate smoothly on GitHub.

---

### Repository Access

- Collaborators have permission to push directly to the repository branches they have access to.
<br>

### ✅ Step 1: Clone the Repository (First Time Only)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pollobkumar/airline-reservation-c.git
cd airline-reservation-c
```
<be>

### ✅ Step 2: Use Your Assigned Branch (Already Created)
No need to create a branch. Branches are already created for you. Just switch.

```bash
git checkout pollob      # For Pollob
git checkout ashiqur     # For Ashiqur
git checkout tanzid      # For Tanzid
```
<be>

### ✅ Step 3: Do Your Work and Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message here"
git push origin pollob      # Replace with your own branch name
```
<br>

### ✅ Step 4: Submit a Pull Request (When Your Task is Done)

1. Go to GitHub and click on “Compare & pull request”, create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to main branch on GitHub.
2. Add a meaningful title and description in the PR.
3. Submit the PR — Team members will review the PR.
4. After approval, the PR will be merged into main branch.

### ⚠️ Important Tips

❌ Never push directly to the main branch <br>
✅ Always pull latest updates before coding:

```bash
git checkout your-branch-name     # e.g., pollob
git pull origin main              # Get updates from main branch
```

📝 Use clear and meaningful commit messages <br>
✅ Stay on your branch unless reviewing/merging <br> <br> <br>



🚀 Let’s begin our tasks! Once your part is done, create a pull request so we can merge everything into the main branch.
Teamwork makes the project perfect! 💪
